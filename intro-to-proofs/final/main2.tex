        Eg. We want to find all homomorphisms $\phi$ from $Z_7$ to  $Z_{12}$. To do this we first consider the possible kernals of $\phi$. We know that kernal is a subgroup of $Z_7$. The possible subgroups are of order 1 and 7 as the subgroup order must divide that of $Z_7$.  There cannot be an injective homomorphism as subgroup in $Z_{12}$ cannot have order of 7. Hence the only possible is mapping all elements to zero. 

\\
        Eg. If $g$ is a generator then for $\phi$ s.t. $\phi(n) = g^{n}$. The kernal of $\phi$ is $nZ$


        \textbf{Isomorphism Theorems}\\
        An isomorphism is a bijecive homomorphism.
        Factor groups correspond to homomorphic images. Every group homomorphism is associated with a normal subgroup $ker \phi$ and every normal subgroup gives rise to homomorphism of groups.

        If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, $k$
