\subsection*{6}
We know that $T(v_1) = A_{1,1}w_1 + \dots + A_{n,1}w_m$. We need to show there exists a basis of $W$ such that all values except for possibly  $A_{1,1}$ is zero.

Consider the case when $T(v_1) = 0$ then we have $A_{1,1} = \dots = A_{n,1} = 0$ for any arbitrary basis of $W$.

If $T(v_1) \ne 0$ then consider all of $A_{2,1},\dots,A{n,1} = 0$ except for $A_{1,1}$ (the element in the first column and row). In this case consdier, 
$$ T(v_1) = w_1 $$ where $w_1$ is an arbitrary vector in $W$. Now we can extend $w_1$ to a basis of $W$.

So in both cases we have a basis of $W$, $w_1,\dots,w_n$ such that only possibly the first row first column element is zero.


\subsection*{10}
Let $A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$
and let 
$B = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$


We get, 
$$ AB = \begin{bmatrix}
    0&1\\
0&0\end{bmatrix}$$
and 
$$ BA = \begin{bmatrix}
    0&0\\
0&0\end{bmatrix}$$ 


So $AB \ne BA$
\subsection*{8}

\begin{proof}
    We need to show $(AB)_{j,.} = A_{j,.}B$

    We know that,
    $$ (AB)_{j,k} = A_{j,.}B_{.,k} $$ 

    So let $j$ be fixed then that means for each value in a given row we multiply $A_{j,.}$ with the curresponding column of $B$. Which means that, 
    $$ (AB)_{j,k} = A_{j,.}B_{.,k} $$ becuse the curresponding columns of $B$ gives us $B$ itself.
\end{proof}
