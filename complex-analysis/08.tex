$\int_{-C} f(z) dz$ represents going backwards from the curve.

An integral along a given curve $C$ can be written as a sum of integrals of curves within it, 
$$ \int_C f(z) dz = \int_{C_1}f(z) dz + \int_{C_2}f(z)dz $$ 

\begin{eg}
   $\int_{C_1} \frac{dz}{z}$  where $C_1$ is the upper semicircle and
   $\int_{C_2} \frac{dz}{z}$ is the lower semicircle.

\end{eg}
\begin{solution}
   For $C_1$
   $$z = re^{i\theta}, r = 1, 0 \le \theta \le \pi$$

   And for $C_2$ we have, 
   $$ z = re^{i\theta}, r = 1, \pi \le \theta \le 2\pi $$ 

   $$dz = ire^{i\theta}d\theta$$

   
   For $C_1$ we have, 
   $$ \int_{C_1} \frac{dz}{z} = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{e^{i\theta}} i e ^{i\theta} d\theta $$ 
   $$= [i \theta]_0^{\pi} =  i\pi$$

   Similarly for $C_2$, 
$$ \int_{C_2} \frac{dz}{z} = - \int_\pi^{2\pi} \frac{1}{e^{i\theta}} i e ^{i\theta} d\theta $$ 
   $$= -[i \theta]_\pi^{2\pi} = [i\pi - i 2\pi] = -i\pi$$

   We see that it is not path independent.

\end{solution}


\begin{theorem}
   Suppose a function $f(z)$ is cont. in $D$ the following statements are equivalent,  

   1. $f(z)$ has an antiderivative $F(z)$ throughout $D$.

   2. Any contours entirely in $D$ all have the same value, 
   $$ \int_{z_1}^{z_2} f(z) dz = F(z)]_{z_1}^{z_2} = F(z_2) - F(z_1) $$ 

   3. $\int_C f(z) = 0$, $C$ closed contours entirely in $D$
\end{theorem}
