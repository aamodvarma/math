- chapter 3, chapter 4 (no 4.6), 6.2 (thrm 6.2.6)
- no perfect set, no baire thoery

Q1)
- 4 statements pick 1
eg. Complement of closed is open
eg. Equivalence of compactness - closed and bounded - open over has a finite cover (prove one of these equivalence)
eg. Continuous functions on compact set achieves maxim and minim.
eg. Continuous function on compact set is uniformly continuous
eg. theorem 7.2.6 (what if we don't have uniform continuous then what happens eg piece wise functions that converge to a delta function)

Q2) 4 questions - T/F
T/F
- About chapter 3 - topology
eg. know definition of limit points and isolated points
eg. justify if sets are open sets and closed sets 

Q3)
About limits of functions, what does it mean to say a limit of a function exists.
- Use definition of limits to justify if a function has limits

Q4) tricky Q here
- About continuity of functions, know definition of continuity (show the limit exists and show it's the value of the function)
- Application of continuous function    
    eg. cont function on compact sets achieve it's max and min (u have negative function and the max has to be negative as well)
    eg. cont function on compact set is uniformly cont
    eg. cont function on an interval then (IVT)

Q5)
4 T/F problems
about continuity
eg. is a certain function continuous
