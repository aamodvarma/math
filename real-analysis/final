at most 10 problems
    - no connected sets, perfect sets, cantor sets, gdelta, fsigma

------------------------------------------------------------------

- know important definitions, convergence of sequence, series, continuity of functions, uniform continuity, convergence of sequences of functions, convergence of series of functions,  limits of functions
    - use the definitions to justify 
        - eg given series/sequences prove they are convergent or not

- true/false

- topology
    - only closed, open, compact

- know countable uncountable, infinite finite

- know diff between pointwise and uniform convergence of series
    - eg. Uniform convergence gives us continutiy
        - what if we don't have uniform convergence, counter example for properties that f_n might have but f does not inherit if pointwise convergence.
    - eg. given a property, each function satisfy the property, but the limit might not satisfy if not uniform convergence.

- know given a sequence, if it's not uniform convergent
    - know how to prove uniform convergence fails

- know how to play with power series
    - show uniform convergence for power series etc. 

- bernstein polynomial to construct polynomials that is uniformly close to continuous function. 
    - play with bernstein polynomial, all formulas will be given

- 1/2 tricky problems

- similar to IVT problem on midterm 2, manipulate problem to apply abels theorem

- power series
    - cauchy critier/M test
    - converge at one point, then absolute at smaller x
    - convergence abs then uniform convergence
